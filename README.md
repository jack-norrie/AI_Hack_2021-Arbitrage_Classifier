# AI_Hack_2021-Arbitrage_Classifier
The final project produced by team Student Ensemble for AI Hack 2021.

AI Hack is the largest student organised AI hackathon in the UK. The Hackathon is a 24-hour competition whereby teams compete in challenges issued by the event sponsors. This submission was for the Kaiko crypto-currency challenge, the submission won 2nd place.

The submitted data science project investigated the predictability of arbitrage events across exchanges listing crypto-currency pairs. The project specifically looked at ETH-USD, it was hypothesised that this pair's perceived volatility would lead to more frequent and lucrative arbitrage opportunities.

The full final report is contained in AI_Hack_2021_Report.pdf and the code used for this project is listed in AI_Hack_Code.R.
