# AI_Hack_2021-Arbitrage_Classifier
AI Hack is the largest student organised AI hackathon in the UK. The Hackathon is a 24-hour competition whereby teams compete in challenges issued by the event sponsors. This repository contains the final project produced by team Student Ensemble for AI Hack 2021. The submission was for the Kaiko crypto-currency challenge, it won 2nd place.

The submitted data science project investigated the predictability of arbitrage events across exchanges listing crypto-currency pairs. The project specifically looked at spot trading data for the ETH-USD pair, it was hypothesised that this pair's perceived volatility would lead to more frequent and lucrative arbitrage opportunities.

The full final report is contained in AI_Hack_2021_Report.pdf and the code used for this project is listed in AI_Hack_Code.R.
